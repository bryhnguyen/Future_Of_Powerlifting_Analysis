# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas for cleaning data and EDA and Tableau for analysis/visualization. Python will also be used for EDA.

## Database Storage
Postgres/pgAdmin for managing the DB and an AWS S3 Bucket for storage of the dataset. Excel will also be used initially to create a mock database.

## Machine Learning
A combination of Scikit-Learn, SciPy, Keras, and TensorFlow will be used in some capacity. Using supervised ML, we will apply Linear Regression to the dataset for training and testing purposes.

## Dashboard
Tableau will be used to create the dashboard. A link to the Tableau dashboard will be found at the top of the README.
