# Technologies Used

## Communication
Slack Group Direct Message, Google Docs for drafting answers/responses to questions from rubric and stated goals, and Google Slides for presentation.

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas for cleaning data and EDA and Tableau for analysis/visualization. Python will also be used for EDA.

## Database Storage
Postgres/pgAdmin for managing the DB and an AWS S3 Bucket for storage of the dataset. Excel will also be used initially to create a mock database.

## Machine Learning
A combination of Scikit-Learn, SciPy, Keras, and TensorFlow will be used in some capacity. Linear regression vs. logistic regression will be compared to determine which will suffice for training and testing.

## Dashboard
A Flask template and D3.js. The finalized Dashboard will be deployed on Github Pages.
