# Mass_Strength_Analysis
# Topic  
Analysis of a powerlifting dataset where historical progression of world class powerlifters will be tracked in order to predict future lift results.

# Reason for selecting topic 
To create a snapshot of the future of the powerlifting sport and performance expectations. 

# Description of the data source
“This dataset is a snapshot of the OpenPowerlifting database as of April 2019. OpenPowerlifting is creating a public-domain archive of powerlifting history. Powerlifting is a sport in which competitors compete to lift the most weight for their class in three separate barbell lifts: the Squat, Bench, and Deadlift.” (openpowerlifting.org/)

# Questions we hope to answer with the data
- How much higher do athletes lift every year? 
- Will athletes plateau at some point?
- Is there a significant difference between weight/age classes in terms of lift progression, historically?
